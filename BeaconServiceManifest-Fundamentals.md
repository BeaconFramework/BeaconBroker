An extensive desription of the beacon service manifest is done in D3.2, D3.3, D4.2 and D4.3 hosted here: http://www.beacon-project.eu/downloads/

What is important to know when you start to interact with beacon service manifest [bsman] is the YAML and HOT (Heat Orchestrator Template)standards.

Basically a bsman is composed by 4 main elements:

* heat_template_version: 2014-10-16

* description: [optional]

* parameters: used to define set of parameters used inside the bsman creation (actually this is used to define default value for the parameters)

* resources: in bsman all are defined as resources, nested or atomically all teh definition are done here

* outputs: [for future usages]
